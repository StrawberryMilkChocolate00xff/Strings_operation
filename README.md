# 字符串控制函数
# functions of control strings
用自己的方式实现一些对字符串操作的函数，以此巩固本人对字符串的理解与运用

### 函数功能
### functions action:
### unsigned short int str_Cpy(char *t, char *s, unsigned long int n)
This function was used to copy strings to another strings

### unsigned short int str_Cmp(char *t, char *s)
This function was used to compare two strings

### unsigned long int str_Len(char *s)
This function was used to get the length of strings

### unsigned short int str_PartCpy(char *t, char *s, unsigned long int offset)
This function was used to copy strings to a part of another strings
